They will enhance your abilities through skills and talents that you can develop and master as your own. Learn how to move faster, focus your inner rampage and dash as fast as a bullet. Explore the vaults and seek for chests and mobs to build your experience as a hunter!</p><p>However, you can't enter a vault without proving your worth. Hence, the Vault Gods require sacrifices before every vault. You will need to offer various items to each Vault God, sometimes in astonishing quantities! As you progress, you will find rare gear and resources, so treasure them well!. Armors will protect you from the dangerous mobs, while swords and axes will make you able to defeat them... before the Vault ends.</p>"
